'''
Conditional Statements combined with operators (comparison or relational,
assignment, arithmetic, and logical).  For each sentence, translate the
sentence to Python code using your operators:

if i is from 2 to 78, subtract 2 from i

if j is not between 10 and 15 but is the
number 11, then k equals j times 2

if k is not equal to 7 and i equals 5 or j
is greater than 8, set x equal to 200
divided by k

if i is the sum of j and k, and j is not
equal to sum of i and k, then x equals j
times k divided by i

Style Guide for all programs

This was adapted from the other instructors Style Guide so that we remain consistent in our teaching of programming styles:

* All labels (names of variables) should be descriptive.
* Labels for numbers and strings should be all lower case with an underscore to separate words (e.g. first_name).
* Labels for constants should be all capitalized, also with an underscore to separate words.
* Labels for functions should be UpperCamelCase (e.g. GetFirstName).
* Labels for functions should include verbs (e.g. getLastName).
* Try to write classes, methods of classes, or functions to house all your code
* Labels for classes should also be UpperCamelCase ( class ClassName: ).
* Labels for classes should be nouns ( class Person: ).

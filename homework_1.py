#
# Write a program that asks the user for their dream job title.  Then ask them for the
# hourly wage they want to earn.  This number should account for dollars and cents.
# Calculate the annual wage they will earn over a year.  Assume they work 48 weeks a
# year (4 weeks vacation) but are paid over 52 weeks.  Then ask them how much
# money they feel they will need at retirement time.  Determine the number of years
# they will have to work to save up their retirement dollar value assuming their only
# source of income was their paycheck?  Finally, determine if the number of years
# they need to save is an even or odd numbers.  For this part, use the modulus operator
# to determine if the number you calculated is and even or odd.  Once you have calculated
# it, use print to print out the value.  You should also print out something like this.  "If
# the value is --- then the number is odd, however, if the value is ---- then the number
# is even."
# Make sure you account for user input error.  Test your code by trying to cause errors
# in input.  It is not important to error check on their dream job title.  Just assume it
# will be a reasonable string.
